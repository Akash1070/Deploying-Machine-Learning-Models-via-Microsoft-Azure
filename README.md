# **Deploying Machine Learning Models via Microsoft Azure**
 The main agenda of this project is:

1. Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Airline Dataset.

2. Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Airline Data to predict Price based on certain features.

3. Deploy the Machine learning model via Microsoft Azure that can be used to make live predictions of Price.
